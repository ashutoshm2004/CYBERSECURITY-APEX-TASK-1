# Lab Setup and Tool Verification Report (Task 5)

## 1. Environment Configuration Proof

The lab uses an isolated Host-Only network for safe testing, ensuring the target is not exposed to the public internet.

* *Attacker:* Kali Linux
* *Target:* Metasploitable2
* *Proof:* Both VMs are configured on the same Host-Only network adapter.

## 2. Tool Verification: Nmap (Network Scanning)

*Goal:* Confirm Kali can reach the target and identify open services for exploitation.

*Command:* nmap [Metasploitable2 IP]

*Result:* Nmap successfully identified numerous open ports, confirming Metasploitable2 is functioning as a vulnerable target.

## 3. Tool Verification: Wireshark (Packet Capture)

*Goal:* Prove the attacker machine can monitor all traffic within the isolated network.

*Process:* Captured ICMP traffic generated by a ping command from Kali to Metasploitable2.

*Proof:* Wireshark successfully isolated the Echo Request and Echo Reply packets.

## 4. Tool Verification: Burp Suite (Web Proxy)

*Goal:* Demonstrate the ability to set up an intercepting proxy for web application testing.

*Process:* Configured Firefox inside Kali to proxy traffic through Burp Suite, then browsed to the Metasploitable2 web server.

*Proof:* Burp Suite successfully intercepted the initial GET request destined for the target IP.
