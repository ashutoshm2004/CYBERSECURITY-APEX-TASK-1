# CYBERSECURITY-APEX-TASK-1

**Project summary**
This repository contains the materials for a hands-on cybersecurity home lab built with VirtualBox, Kali Linux (attacker), and a deliberately vulnerable target. It includes a lab setup report (PDF with screenshots), foundational notes on networking and cryptography, and practical cheat-sheets for Linux and common pentest tools.


**Deliverables**
- `📝 Lab_Setup_Report` — step-by-step report with required screenshots (VirtualBox, Kali, Metasploitable, Wireshark captures)
- `📚 FOUNDATION/Task3_Networking_Notes.md` — OSI, TCP/IP model, and subnetting notes.
- `📚 FOUNDATION/Task4_Cryptography_Notes.md` — symmetric/asymmetric crypto, hashing, and OpenSSL examples.
- `🔧 CHEAT_SHEETS/Linux_CLI_CheatSheet.md` — essential Linux commands for Task 2.
- `🔧 CHEAT_SHEETS/Tool_Commands_CheatSheet.md` — Nmap and Netcat commands for Task 6.


**Video walkthrough**
